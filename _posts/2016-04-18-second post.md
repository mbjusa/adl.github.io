Today we play with markdown !! This would be the first header!!
==============================
I wonder what I should talk about???

This would be a second header !!!
----------

#this should be some big text.#
## this should be smaller text2.#
### this should be even smaller text3.#
#### this should be even smaller text4.#
##### this should be even smaller text5.#
###### this should be even smaller text6.#
** this text should be bold and the next line is a link**
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
[mbjgithub](https://github.com/)

**<let's see if I can get a whole paragraph is bold text.
I wonder what will happen..... it should be interesting to
find out after this all gets rendered.
Markdown is pretty easy to use I think !!!!>

This is some normal text. I am creating a line break right here
to see if it follows it.
